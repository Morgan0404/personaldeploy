      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Morgan James, an aspiring software developer at Exeter
        University with a passion for tackling sustainability challenges and
        enhancing tech education. My technical toolkit includes Java, Python,
        HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Azure VM, and Linux, complemented by
        strengths in problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. I've
        contributed to impactful projects, such as "LeftOver Chef," which won
        third place at Google DevFest for addressing food waste, and developed a
        full-stack web application, showcasing my versatility in both front-end
        and back-end development. Through roles like Coding Assistant at Code
        Ninjas and Team Leader at Exeter's Python workshop, I've honed my
        ability to make complex concepts accessible and engaging. I'm eager to
        dive into an internship that challenges me to grow further, combining my
        technical skills and collaborative spirit to drive innovation in
        software development.
